# vbzJSLib

This library/collection of Javascript items is to proved others and myself with examples, and handy utilities in one spot. Sort of a reference.

## Motivation

Needed a place to archive handy utilities and examples in JS


## Installation or Getting Started

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project, e.g.,

	git clone https://github.com/vbitzceo/vbzJSLib.git
  
  Navigate through the folders for a topic that interests you and browse the examples.
  I use node to run most of these examples on my local machine.
